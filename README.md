This is my first 2D game. It's a airplane shooter game. 
<ul>
<li>There is only one level.</li>
<li>You have 5 lives at the begining.</li>
<li>Your weapons are Machine gun and Rockets. </li>
<li>Enemy Planes have 2 lifes if you are shooting them with machine gun or 1 life if you are using rockets.</li>
<li>Your goal is to get as much points as you can.</li>
</li><li>High score is set to give you +50 for every plane destroyed by machine gun, or +10 if it's destroyed by rocket.
<ul>
The game is not yet ready. I am working every day to fix some of the bugs.

The commitments start from 3-rd Update because I have problems with GitHub (I wasn't used to work there), so the
update 1 and update 2 are in update 3. 
Don't worry everything is here ^_^ .
